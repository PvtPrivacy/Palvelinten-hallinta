# A

For this assignment I completely destroyed all the virtual machines and started from the scratch. It was relatively easy to setup all necessary steps for me to procced to this assignment.

I made directory.
```
sudo mkdir -p /srv/salt/hello/
```
Inside of the hello folder I began creating and editing a new file called init.sls
```
$ sudoedit init.sls
```
Inside I added two following lines (This took me a while, because I didn't remember that you had to add a space before the file.managed file.
```
/tmp/hellome:
 file.managed
```
After saving the file, I entered the following command.
```
sudo salt-call --local state.apply hello
```

As you can see, it was succesful.

# B 
This was a bit complex for me, so I decided to do the most simplest way for this assignment.
```
$ sudoedit /srv/salt/top.sls
```
```
base:
  '*':
    - hello
```
After that I paste the following line.

```
sudo salt '*' state.apply
```

As you can see it did what it should have.

# C&D 

Unfortunately this assignment I couldn't really complete in my PC at home for some reason, though if I correctly remember this is something that I did previously on my laptop.
