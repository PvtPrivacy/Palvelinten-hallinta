# X Windows Package Manager

- Make sure you install git before entering this command, otherwise it won't work at all `salt-run winrepo.update_git_repos`
- pkg.install = installs the package using a package manager.
- pkg.installed = checks if minion has installed the particular package in question
- pkg.remove = Removes the package in question.
- "Package definition files can be hosted in one or more Git repositories."
- pkg.refresh_db = Orders minions to create a database entry for every package definition file.

### Summary
- The objective of this project is to have SaltStack install VirtualBox for Linux and it to be used in a browser (phpVirtualBox)

### Other sidenotes

- Eetu95 uses 8GB Ram with Intel Core i5 4960k, from my perspective these specs are decent, but don't expact any perfroamnce loses with these specs.
- Really interesting project Eetu95 had.

## Summary
- The main objective of this project was to ease elder's routines by creating a command that would install firefox in the computer and after that firefox would open the Neftlix website.

### Other sidenotes

- I must admit, this project was very clever. The author used Windows 11 and AMD Ryzen 7 processor with 8 GB of Ram.

## Summary
- The author was extermely straight forward with this project. The intention of this project was to connect to the desktop via VNC-viewer using its IP address.
- VNC-viewer is a remote desktop connection manager.

### Other sidenotes
- Nothing much really to mention about this project, I think the author should have added more context and explained a bit more about his project and how did he do it.

# C

I decided to try the second project, as it was more interesting and detailed. For this starters I completely destroyed all my virtual machines and started from the scratch. I updated the vagrant file with this before I intiated them.

So the author had problems with installing Firefox via command line and had to make some complicated steps in order to function it proprely. Fortunately I managed to install firefox by adding dash and word "esr". Everything was going smootly until I couldn't really move forward to the next step, as I couldn't really understand how she proceed in this case. (Instructions were vague/unclear)

# D & Ideas  

- I want computers to have micro installed and be set as a default text editor. = Eazes coders life
- Borwser that directs you to a web page immediately after you launch it = Helps individuals to get started
- Maybe some kind of additional plugins for micro? = Comfortoness
- Certain applications should be installed right away! = Easiness/Ready for action
- PC to be configured correctly? = Less complixity & headace.
