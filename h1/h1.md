## Salt Installation via Windows )

I managed to install Salt via Windows during the class, since I was having technical diffuclties on installing it via Linux, I couldn't really proceed on the Linux part, fortunately the teacher managed to show us that Salt can be installed in other operating systems than in Linux (In this case Windows)

I wen't through a website called https://docs.saltproject.io/salt/install-guide/en/latest/ where I installed an .exe file for the salt.

I then ran the .exe file and after following the steps of the installation, it was succesfully installed.

! Make sure you run Windows Shell with admin privilleges, otherwise it will not function properly and won't follow the commands.

I decided to ran a command called 

salt-call --local grains.items

the command would collect infomation about the system.

Here is a small piece of infomation it managed to collect about the system. 

## Vagrant Installation (Unsuccesful)

During the course, we were instructed to install Vagarant and the VirtualBox Oracle.

VirtualBox Oracle was installed succesfully and was fully operational.

The Vagarant part was a bit tricky. 

Even though I managed to install succesfully Vagarant and type certain commands via Windows Shell, it failed to create a virtual machine, despite several attempts and restarts later.

I did notified the teacher about this issue, but so far any solutions haven't been found yet. Fortunately it wasn't a big catastrophe and I could perfrom couple of tasks without using virtual machine or linux.
