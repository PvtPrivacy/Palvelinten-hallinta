  # A

I installed Salt Minion for the Windows. I tested if it's working properly so I typed in the powershell terminal `salt-call --local`

Seems to be working, from my point of view at least.

  # B

 `salt-call --local grains.items`

- mem_total = Tells you how much ram is found within this computer.
- manufacturer = Tells you who manufactured this computer (My PC is pre-built)
- timezone: = Tells you in what timezone my pc is currently assigned to/uses.

  # C

I created an empty text file.

I then inserted a command.

`salt-call --local -l info state.single file.managed 'C:\Users\Dan\H5tht\hello.txt' contents='Hello everyone, welcome back to FNAF.'`

By pasting this command it will insert contents inside of the text file I created, meaning it copypastes the texts to it.

  # D

  I am kind of unsure of what do you need to do in this assignment, so I did my best according to my interpertation of this task.

  I entered a command `Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users\Dan\H5tht` which would showcase me all the files inside of the `H5tht` and when it was last

  # E 

  I unfortunately didn't understand completely of what I was supposed to do in this task, since this tasks was a bit vague for me to understand.
