### A.

- For this assignment I created a new repository.

- I also installed git as well.

### B.

- I cloned the repository to the `t001` host and it was succesful without any issues, I then checked the host if I can find the repository and the files inside of it.

- Here it is.

### C.

- I edited the git file `Summer.git` and added a following line in it `I don't like the summer, I hate it!`(Notice that the word "No" was already there prior to this)

- After saving it I entered a command line.
- Because I haven't done the git commit command, it only saved this changes locally, so in other words I cannot see the new lines I added in github.

- I want to reset everything I changed.

`git reset --hard`

- Now the new lines I added were removed and it was reset.

### D.

- I used the command `git log` to check the history of commits that have occured.

- As you can see, you can see the author who made the commit (in this case me) as well as the email of the author. (censored in yellow line)
- Since everything is in order I don't have to change author's name or his email, but if had to, I would use these commands below me to change them.

`git config --global user.name "FIRST_NAME LAST_NAME"`

`git config --global user.email "MY_NAME@example.com"`

>[!IMPORTANT]
>You technically have to do it at the beginning of setting up the git.
